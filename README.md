# LabView-Optical-Tweezer

This labview program does few things:
1. This has a remote control for the slide of a microscope stage used in Optical Tweezer. It can be controlled in 3 directions using a wireless Joystick at various speeds just like a gaming software.
2. Clicking on the screen provides the option to move the motor position to the clicked position that will help easy capture of particles.
3. Fast data feed and acquisition.
